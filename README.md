# Markdown Renderer

This project provides a simple, single-page web application to render Markdown files into styled HTML using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling and [Marked.js](https://marked.js.org/) for Markdown parsing.

## Features

*   **Markdown to HTML Conversion:** Automatically fetches `input.md` and converts its content to HTML.
*   **Responsive Design:** Built with Tailwind CSS, ensuring a pleasant viewing experience across various devices.
*   **Client-Side Rendering:** All rendering is performed directly in the browser.

## Setup and Usage

1.  **Save the files:** Ensure `index.html`, `README.md`, `LICENSE`, and `input.md` are all in the same directory.
2.  **Prepare `input.md`:** Create or place your Markdown content in a file named `input.md` in the same directory.
3.  **Open `index.html`:** Simply open `index.html` in your web browser. The application will automatically fetch `input.md` and display its rendered HTML content.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** Structure of the web page.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** For responsive and utility-first styling.
*   **Marked.js:** A fast Markdown parser and compiler written in JavaScript.
